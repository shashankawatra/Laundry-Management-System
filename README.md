# Laundry-Management-System
We present the design and implementation of a laundry management system used in a laundry establishment. Laundry firms are usually faced with difficulties in keeping detailed records of customers clothing; this little problem as seen to most laundry firms is highly discouraging as customers are filled with disappointments, arising from issues such as customer clothes mix-ups and untimely retrieval of clothes. The aim of this application is to determine the number of clothes collected, in relation to their owners, as this also helps the users fix a date for the collection of their clothes. Also customerâ€™s information is secured, as a specific id is allocated per registration to avoid contrasting information.
